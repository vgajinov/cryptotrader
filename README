EXCHANGE BACKENDS

GIT SUBMODULES:
   The exchange backends are submodules of this repository. To add a new exchange:
      git submodule add <REPO URL> exchange_backends/<EXCHANGE NAME>

   To update the submodule with the changes from its repo:
      git submodule update

FACTORY PATTERN:
   1- Any new backend needs to be as a class, called wrap<Exchange>.py, and has to 
      inherit from the abstract class exchange.
   2- exchangeFactory.py needs to be updated to detect and return the added exchange
      when requested. Also, to import the new added class.
