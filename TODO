GUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. BUG:
       CandleChart works fine for small intervals, but has an issue with big intervals.
       Only few candles are shown.

2. ENH:
       Improve the display of trading symbols.
       - implement something similar to Binance (sorting by symbol, volume and change)
       - either as a combobox popup or completely new solution

3. FIX:
       Find a better way to display bids, asks and trades.
       Current implmementation for font resizing is not very robust.

5. ENH:
       Connect PlaceOrder widget functionality with REST clients

6. ENH:
       Active trades widget needs to be updated from exchanges.
       Prefer WS client for tracking orders and trades if possible.
