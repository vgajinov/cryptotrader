This is a placeholder for exchange api keys.
This folder is used by demos and unit tests for working with authenticated endpoints.

Except this file and the gitignore file all other content of this folder is ignored by git, so your private keys want be tracked for obvious security reasons.

Demos and unit tests expect the key files to have the following format: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<exchange_name_lowercase>.key
