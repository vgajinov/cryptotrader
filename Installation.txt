Install Qt5.9
=================================

Download Qt5.9 setup from this address:
   https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.2/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.9.2.run

Follow installation instructions from this page:
   https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
or alternatively from here:
   https://www.linuxhint.com/install-qt-5-9-1-qt-creator-4-3-1-ubuntu/
   
In my case, setup didn't select any of the Qt options, so I selected all except Android related options.


Install PyQt5
=================================

Go to the PyQt website,
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5
and download wheel file for linux:
   PyQt5-5.9-5.9.2-cp35.cp36.cp37-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
   
You first need to install SIP:
   pip3 install sip
This will not work for python version < 3.6

Use pip to install the pyqt module:
   pip3 install PyQt5-5.9-5.9.2-cp35.cp36.cp37-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
or
   pip3 install PyQt5==5.9.2
